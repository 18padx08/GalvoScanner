/** @mainpage Custom Programming Library for TDC
 *
 *  @ref tdcbase.h "Tdcbase" is a library that allows custom
 *  programming for the TDC time-to-digital converter.
 *  It allows to configure the device, aquire timestamps,
 *  and calculate start stop histograms.
 *
 *  @ref tdcbase.h declares functions for device control and timestamp acquisition.
 *
 *  @ref tdcstartstop.h allows to generate start stop histograms in the PC.
 *
 *  @ref tdchbt.h provides photon statistics with g(2) functions and fit to models.
 *
 *  @ref tdclifetm.h provides functions for lifetime measurement.

/** @file tdcbase.h
 *  @brief Control and data acquisition functions for TDC
 *
 *  The header defines functions that allow to control the TDC time-to-digital
 *  converter and acquire data from it. The received timestamp data can be
 *  retrieved programatically or stored in a file. They are also processed
 *  to a set of histograms internally.
 *
 *  Use @ref TDC_init to start and connect to the device and
 *  @ref TDC_deInit to close the connection. Set device parameters with
 *  @ref TDC_setExposureTime etc. and enable Measurement with
 *  @ref TDC_enableChannels. Customize the timestamp buffer with
 *  @ref TDC_setTimestampBufferSize and retrieve timestamps with
 *  @ref TDC_getLastTimestamps or @ref TDC_writeTimestamps.
 *
 *  @ref TDC_inputTimestamps, @ref TDC_readTimestamps, and
 *  @ref TDC_generateTimestamps allow to work with generated or saved timestamps.
 *  Interference with real data from the device should be avoided.
 *  If no device is connected, the library falls into a demo mode where all
 *  parameter setting and getting calls return without error.

/** Generate Timestamps
 *
 *  The function generates synthetic timestamps for demonstration
 *  and simulation purposes. Timesamps are processed just like "raw"
 *  data from a real device.
 *
 *  The channel mask (see @ref TDC_enableChannels) is considered. At least
 *  one channel has to be enabled!
 *  @param type     Type of time diff distribution
 *  @param par      Type specific parameter set. Parameters should be
 *                  chosen so that most time diffs are positive.
 *                  Negative diffs are dropped.
 *  @param count    Number of timestamps to generate
 *  @return  Error code
