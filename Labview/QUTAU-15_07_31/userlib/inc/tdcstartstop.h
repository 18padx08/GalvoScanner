 *  @brief Start Stop Histograms
 *
 *  The header defines functions that process TDC data to a set of start stop
 *  histograms. Every histogram has a start and stop input channel; histograms
 *  are provieded for all combinations of those.
 *  Only the first stop event after a start is counted.
 *  The histograms are calculated on the PC.
 *
 *  Use the functions of @ref tdcbase.h to control the device.
 *  @ref TDC_setHistogramParams allows to configure the histogram functions,
 *  @ref TDC_getHistogram is used to retrieve the data.
 *  If a set of data is required that belongs to the same time, use
 *  @ref TDC_freezeBuffers to synchronize.

 *

/** Retrieve Start Stop Histogram
 *
 *  Retrieves one of the start stop histograms accumulated internally.
 *  One histogram is provided for the time differences of every event
 *  the device has detected (channel independent). 64 histograms are
 *  provided for the time differences of events detected on different
 *  channels. Events on the first channel reset the time counter,
 *  events on the second one integrate the current counter value in
 *  the Histogram.
 *  @param chanA     First TDC channel of the channel pair. Range 0...7
 *                   begins with 0 for channel 1.
 *                   If this parameter is out of range (negative e.g.)
 *                   the channel independent histogram is retrieved.
 *  @param chanB     Second TDC channel of the channel pair (0...7).
 *                   If this parameter is out of range (negative e.g.)
 *                   the channel independent histogram is retrieved.
 *  @param reset     If the histogram should be cleared after retrieving.
 *  @param data      Output: Histogram data. The array must have at least
 *                   binCount (see @ref TDC_setHistogramParams ) elements.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
 *  @param count     Output: Total number of time diffs in the histogram.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
 *  @param tooSmall  Output: Number of time diffs that were smaller
 *                   than the smallest histogram bin.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
 *  @param tooLarge  Output: Number of time diffs that were bigger
 *                   than the biggest histogram bin.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
 *  @param eventsA   Output: Number of events detected on the first channel
 *                   contributing to the histogram.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
 *  @param eventsB   Output: Number of events detected on the second channel
 *                   contributing to the histogram.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
 *  @param expTime   Output: Total exposure time for the histogram: the time
 *                   difference between the first and the last event
 *                   that contribute to the histogram. In timebase units.
 *                   A NULL pointer is allowed to ignore the data.
